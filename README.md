# Waves and Ice Cream

## Purpose
The purpose of the analysis was to identify temperature trends on the island of O'ahu, HI. Information gained will contibute to the decisions related to opening a surf and shake shop for locals and tourists. The primary concern is whether a surfboard and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results
The analysis uncovered several significant differences in seasonal temperature trends, including:
- An average daily temperature difference of nearly 4 degrees between June (74.9) and December (71.0).
- A minimum temperature difference of 8 degrees between June (64) and December (56).
- Less temperature variability in June (std: 3.26) than in December (std: 3.75).

## Summary
Although the analysis gives some insight into seasonal temperature differences, results could be more informative. The data includes temperature readings at a range of elevations. As the future surf and shake shop will ideally be located at or near sea level, future analysis should only include temperature date from sources at or near sea level. It is possible temperature data from higher elevations are currently skewing temperature data. In addition, other climate variables may impact the success of the business. It is likely the surf and shake shop will be less busy on rainy days. It is suggested a future analysis evaluates the amount of precipitation per day (i.e. number of days with precipitation) to gain an understanding of how many 'good' days for business are expected.
